This project is an implementation of Cranio Creations' board game "Masters of Renaissance".

The application uses a client-server connection to allow players to communicate with an instance of the game and play a whole match, through the use of the CLI or a GUI.
Through socket implementation, multiple clients can connect to the same server and play multiple matches concurrently.
An user can also reconnect to an ongoing match that he previously left, provided that at least one player is still connected to the game.
